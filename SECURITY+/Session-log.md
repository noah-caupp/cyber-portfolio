  2. Root CA's usually issue lower-level intermediate certificates
  3. Root CA's are usually offline to keep them secure

  5. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that reads and reports CRL's (Certificate Revokation List)
  6. CRL's are a master list of revoked/untruted certificates
  7. FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
  8. A wildcard certificate takes care of Subdomains like *.github.com
  9. Code-signing certificate is for application

  1. AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing.
